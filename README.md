Manage your application config as a typesafe struct in as little as two function calls.

```go
type MyConfig struct {
	DatabaseUrl string `config:"DATABASE_URL"`
	FeatureFlag bool   `config:"FEATURE_FLAG"`
	Port        int // tags are optional. PORT is assumed
	...
}

var c MyConfig
err := config.FromEnv().To(&c)
```

## How It Works

It's just simple, pure stdlib. 

* A field's type determines what [strconv](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/) function is called.
* All string conversion rules are as defined in the [strconv](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/) package
* time.Duration follows the same parsing rules as [time.ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time#ParseDuration)
* If chaining multiple data sources, data sets are merged. 
  Later values override previous values.
  ```go
  config.From("dev.config").FromEnv().To(&c)
  ```
    
* Unset values remain intact or as their native [zero value](https://tour.golang.org/basics/12) 
* Nested structs/subconfigs are delimited with double underscore 
    * e.g. `PARENT__CHILD`
* Env vars map to struct fields case insensitively
    * NOTE: Also true when using struct tags.
* Any errors encountered are aggregated into a single error value
    * the entirety of the struct is always attempted
    * failed conversions (i.e. converting "x" to an int) and file i/o are the only sources of errors
        * missing values are not errors

## Why you should use this

* It's the cloud-native way to manage config. See [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/config)
* Simple:
    * only 2 lines to configure.
* Composeable:
    * Merge local files and environment variables for effortless local development.
* small:
    * only stdlib 
    * < 180 LoC
    
## Design Philosophy

Opinionated and narrow in scope. This library is only meant to do config binding. 
Feel free to use it on its own, or alongside other libraries.  

* Only structs at the entry point. This keeps the API surface small.  

* Slices are space delimited. This matches how environment variables and commandline args are handled by the `go` cmd.

* No slices of structs. The extra complexity isn't warranted for such a niche usecase.

* No maps. The only feature of maps not handled by structs for this usecase is dynamic keys.

* No pointer members. If you really need one, just take the address of parts of your struct.
